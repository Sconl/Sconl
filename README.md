# Hello, I am Sconl Peter

I build systems for moments when decisions matter.

Not dashboards for curiosity.  
Not tools for noise.  
But operational systems for environments where error is expensive and hesitation is costly.

My work sits at the intersection of:

- Decision architecture  
- Secure systems engineering  
- Privacy-first infrastructure  

Technology is not the objective.  
Clarity is.

---

## Why This Exists

Most organizations are not short on data.

They are short on:

- Structured thinking under pressure  
- Execution discipline  
- Infrastructure integrity  

As uncertainty rises, complexity compounds.  
Most software adds to it.

I build systems that reduce it.

## What You’ll Find Here

This GitHub functions as a systems laboratory.

Repositories focus on:

- Decision modeling engines  
- Execution orchestration frameworks  
- Secure operational tooling  

Each project documents:

- Assumptions  
- Tradeoffs  
- Security posture  

If a system cannot explain itself, it cannot be trusted.

## Engineering Principles

**Clarity over abstraction**  
Understandable systems outperform clever ones.

**Privacy by default**  
Data collection is explicit. Surface area is intentional.

**Operational realism**  
Design accounts for cost, failure, and constraint.

---

## Current Direction

- Building a cohesive open-source decision systems suite  
- Formalizing privacy-conscious infrastructure patterns  
- Publishing long-form work on decision architecture  

This is long-term work.  
Durability over trend alignment.

---

## Alignment

If you work in:

- Capital allocation  
- Institutional systems  
- Security-sensitive environments  

We are likely solving adjacent problems.
