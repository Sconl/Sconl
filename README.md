# Sconl

I design and build operational systems that enable clear, accountable decision-making under uncertainty.

My work sits at the intersection of:

- Decision architecture  
- Secure systems engineering  
- Privacy-preserving infrastructure  
- Operational execution design  

Technology is not the objective.  
Clarity is.

## What This GitHub Represents

This profile is the technical laboratory behind a broader thesis:

> Systems that reduce cognitive friction while preserving integrity, traceability, and privacy.

The repositories here (and within the associated organization) focus on:

- Decision modeling engines  
- Execution orchestration frameworks  
- Audit and trace systems  
- Cost-aware infrastructure patterns  
- Secure-by-default tooling  

Each project documents:

- Assumptions  
- Tradeoffs  
- Architecture decisions  
- Security posture  
- Operational constraints

## Engineering Principles

**Clarity over abstraction.**  
If a system cannot explain its logic, it cannot be trusted.

**Privacy by default.**  
Telemetry is explicit. Surface area is minimal.

**Smallest effective surface.**  
Tools are composable, not bloated.

**Operational realism.**  
Everything is designed with deployment, cost, and failure modes in mind.

**Transparent tradeoffs.**  
Architecture decisions are recorded and versioned.

## Current Focus

- Building a cohesive open-source decision systems suite  
- Designing privacy-conscious infrastructure patterns  
- Publishing long-form work on decision architecture and execution

## Alignment

If your work involves capital allocation, institutional systems, infrastructure integrity, or high-consequence execution — we likely think about problems in similar ways.
