# Hello, I am Sconl Peter

I build systems for moments when decisions matter.

Not dashboards for curiosity.  
Not tools for cognitive overload.  
But operational systems for environments where error is expensive and hesitation is costly.

My work sits at the intersection of:

- Decision architecture  
- Secure systems engineering  
- Privacy-first infrastructure  

Technology is not the objective.  
Clarity is.

## Why This Exists

Most organizations are not short on data.

They are short on:

- Structured thinking under pressure  
- Execution discipline  
- Infrastructure integrity  

As uncertainty rises, complexity compounds.  
Most software adds to it.

I build systems that reduce it.

## What You’ll Find Here

This GitHub functions as a systems laboratory.

The core projects live under the **q-space** organization and focus on:

- Decision modeling engines  
- Execution orchestration frameworks  
- Secure operational tooling  

Each system documents:

- Assumptions  
- Tradeoffs  
- Security posture  

If a system cannot explain itself, it cannot be trusted.

## Selected Projects

- **[QSpacePages](https://github.com/q-space/pages)**  
  Structured digital presence infrastructure.

- **[QSpacePay](https://github.com/q-space/payments)**  
  Controlled payment orchestration layer.

- **[QSpacePulse](https://github.com/q-space/pulse)**  
  Decision telemetry and signal monitoring.

Together, they form a cohesive decision systems suite.

## Current Focus

![Focus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Focus-Decision%20Systems%20Suite-2ea043?style=flat)

Building privacy-conscious infrastructure designed for high-consequence environments.

## Engineering Principles

**Clarity over abstraction**  
Understandable systems outperform clever ones.

**Privacy by default**  
Data collection is explicit. Surface area is intentional.

**Operational realism**  
Design accounts for cost, failure, and constraint.

## Alignment

If your work involves:

- Capital allocation  
- Institutional systems  
- Security-sensitive environments  

We are likely solving adjacent problems.
